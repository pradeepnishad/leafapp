                We are a group of few students in Mumbai developed this software because we <br>
                want notepad a little cool and good looking from the default one with some  <br>
                addititonal features .This program is free  and definately it will be useful.<br>
                If you are looking for a really simple notepad  with all basic features and some<br> 
                aesthetic background that is easy to get started with, then Leaf application may<br> 
                be a good starting point. It can be used without any limitations or obligations.
